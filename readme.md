# EDA-Titanic  
Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of the famous Titanic passenger dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to investigate factors influencing passenger survival, highlight key patterns, and practice data-analysis workflows (data cleansing, visualization, insight extraction).

## 🔍 Motivation  
- Strengthen my analytical skills using Python and data-science libraries.  
- Practice storytelling with data: turning raw records into meaningful conclusions.  
- Create a project that showcases my analytical mindset for future job applications.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- Google Colab
